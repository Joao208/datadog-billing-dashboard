  "message": "{{#is_alert}}\n\nThe number of hosts with active APM has exceeded the limit of 10, which may result in unexpected additional charges.\n\n**How to investigate and resolve:**\n\n1. **Check the count of hosts with APM:** Use Datadog tools or other monitoring tools to list all hosts with active APM.\n\n2. **Evaluate the necessity of additional hosts:** Determine if all hosts with APM are necessary or if there are duplications or misconfigurations.\n\n3. **Disable APM on unnecessary hosts:** If possible, disable APM on hosts that are not critical for performance analysis or are not being actively used.\n\n4. **Review APM settings:** Ensure that APM is configured only for essential services and hosts.\n\n5. **Continuously monitor:** Continue monitoring the count of hosts with APM to avoid future overages and potential additional costs.\n\n{{/is_alert}}",
